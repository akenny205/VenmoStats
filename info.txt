goal of this project:
 - parse csv files easily (venmo data)
 - run all sorts of calculations and analysis
 - make it easy to interact with these methods
 - create an algorithm that determines if a message on venmo is a spurt of random letters
    or an actual message (create a scale/strength rating)
    - possibly based on distance from each key on a phone
